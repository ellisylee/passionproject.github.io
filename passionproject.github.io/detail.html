                  <h1>Lecture Hall Desk Redesign</h1>
                  <p class="lead">A full-time student spends somewhere between 16 - 20 hours a week in a lecture hall. That is a big chunk of someone’s life spent in a learning environment and our team of seven, figured that it should be optimized in such a way to improve the learning experience.</p>
                  <div id="main-slider">
                    <div class="item"><img alt="" src="img/slider/lecture%20hall%20mind%20map.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
                    <div class="item"><img alt="" src="img/slider/lecture%20ellis.gif" class="img-responsive"></div>

                  <!-- /#main-slider-->
                  <p>We decided to conduct an error analysis and redesign of the lecture hall desks of Peterson Hall since it holds a vast majority of UCSD lectures and plays a vital role in the education of students, ourselves included. Without a doubt, the desks in lecture halls could be largely improved in various ways. Our design focused on improving the two most vital problems:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>User Mobility</li>
                    <li>Personal Space</li>
                  </ol>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>This project was personal. As students, we've faced these problems ourselves. We use the lecture hall desks everyday, yet we still make mistakes. "How do I take it out?", "how do I strategically place my materials?", are all questions that make the user feel inadequate for not knowing this first hand. However, these are just a few of the many inconveniences that we have grown to tolerate.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <h2>Observations and Interviews</h2>
                  <p>By observing students during a lecture, we could naturally observe students from afar without any risk of altering their behavior. We observed students at different times of the day, allowing us to compare and contrast students of different majors. For example, a computer science major would almost always use his/her laptop during lecture, while any other major would likely be split between laptops and notebooks. Some of the things we noticed were:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li><b>Space constraints</b> - we could clearly see the some students were cramped. Many had their elbows against their body despite the desks having armrests.</li> 
                          <li><b>Mobility issues</b> - some students had trouble reaching for their backpacks on the floor without moving the desk. This either lead to students securing their writing utensils, or having those utensils fall.</li>
                          <li><b>Lifespan</b> - some desks appeared to be slanted towards the student. Some desks were floppy, resulting in an unstable rotation of the desk. The chairs, desks, and parts that hold them together have aged considerably and noticeably over the years, as indicated by a few students.</li></ol>

                  <p>We then interviewed 20 students. Asking them a range of questions from, "What was your first experience like with these types of lecture hall desks?" to, "Could you show me how you organize your things on the desk?" Some of their answers surprised us:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>14 students said the desk was too small</li>
                      <img src=img/lecture%20hall%20desk%20size.png>
                    <li>5 students made the mistake of rotating in the wrong direction</li>
                      <img src="img/lecture%20rotate.png">
                      <li>1 student didn’t even know there was a desk</li>
                      <img src=img/lecture%20chill.png>
                  </ul>
                    <h2>Root Problem Analysis</h2>
                    <p>We identified four main problems with the desks:</p>
                    <ol> <li><b>Focus Shift</b> - non-intuitive desk designs call for more mental effort to understand how the desk is supposed to function</li>
                        <li><b>Lack of Standardization</b> - Various lecture hall desks unfold and close in different motions</li>
                        <li><b>Desk Size</b> - Size of desks are not adequate enough to hold all school supplies</li>
                        <li><b>Lefty desks</b> - limited left handed desks restrict the student from being able to sit wherever they want</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Redesign and Design Space</h2>
                    <p>Our team focused on using the double diamond method for redesigning the desk. Our three designs focused on the design spaces of mobility, desk size, and personal space. We considered a variety of different redesigns. Our first design was focused on what we collectively thought would be the biggest problem: how to open the desk without good signifiers.</p>
                    <h3>Design 1: "up-and-over"</h3>
                    <img src="img/design1.png">
                  
                    <p>Design 1 focused on the design space of mobility and the system used to open the desk. We believe that, although the desk affords retractability, the signifiers are unclear. We wanted to build a desk that would create a better conceptual model for users to understand how to take out the desk. We initially considered airplane style desks that come down from the back of the chair in front, but that would block people trying to walk through the aisle. These thoughts led us to think about why the desk was so small.</p>
                    <p>Instead of swinging out to reach the “desk mode,” we designed a rectangular “up-and-over” desk that would be pulled up from the side and placed over the lap area (as seen in the figure above).</p>
                    <h3>Design 2: "half-crescent"</h3>
                    <img src=img/lecture%20crescent.png>
                    <p>In Design 2, our team wanted to focus on the design space of personal space. To accommodate people of both handedness and of every size, we decided to design the desk to be a crescent shape like the one pictured above. The constraints of the original swinging design are designed well and result in only one viable option to operate the desk to achieve the “desk mode” and the “retracted mode.” 
                    In the opened mode, it can only be moved to the retracted mode through one particular set of actions. Similarly, from retracted mode to the desk mode, there is only one course of possible action to take, so it is difficult to break the desk.
</p>
   <h3> Final Redesign</h3>  
                    <img src="img/lecture%20final.png">
                    <p>Our final redesign takes inspiration from our interviews, speculations, and previous design ideas.  We wanted to compile all the main points into one complete lecture desk, minimizing tradeoffs and maximizing efficiency.</p>
                    <p>We begn with the crescent-shaped desk that swings out (like how they do now) via a hinge.  To open up the desk, the user will grab it from the right side and rotate it counterclockwise. Rotating the desk clockwise means pulling the desk at an awkward angle. Thus, we wanted to make sure that our desk opens in a natural, ergonomic fashion. Minimizing the gap between armrests would constrain the student into only being able to rotate the desk in one direction. </p>
